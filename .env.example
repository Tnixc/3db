# GitHub OAuth App Credentials
# Create a GitHub OAuth App at: https://github.com/settings/developers
# IMPORTANT: Make sure to create an OAuth App, NOT a GitHub App
#
# Configuration:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/settings/developers
# 2. Click "New OAuth App" (NOT "New GitHub App")
# 3. Set Authorization callback URL to:
#    - Local: http://localhost:5173/auth/callback
#    - Production: https://your-domain.vercel.app/auth/callback
# 4. The app will automatically request 'repo' scope for full repository access
#
# Troubleshooting:
# - If you get "Resource not accessible by integration" errors:
#   1. Make sure you created an OAuth App (not GitHub App)
#   2. Users may need to revoke and re-authorize at https://github.com/settings/applications
#   3. Check the logs for "[Auth] Received token with scopes" to verify granted permissions
# - The app requires the 'repo' scope to create/update/delete files in repositories
